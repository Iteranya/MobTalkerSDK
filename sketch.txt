It has come to my attention that I am an absolute Neanderthal

I did NOT apparently, setup my Python Project on the SDK properly

The only reason why it works is

1. I did not use any dependency
2. It only requires 3 files to works
3. Sheer Dumb Luck
4. (Also maybe because I deal with Pure Data)

And due to that, I uhhhhhh.......

Well, EVENTUALLY I, or someone else, would have to do this, YEA!?!?!

But NOW... Hear Me Out

Script Makers are not programmers
^ They are, this is terrible excuse

AND LIKE if I went this long without realizing that imports doesn't works
Or that there are no __init__.py anywhere in this codebase...
^ It's pure dumb Luck

This just means that I can, ONCE AGAIN! Avoid the Problem Like a Coward!!!
^ This part is true

So... Let's think about it...

If I am a script maker, what would I want???

How do I want to get this... "Zen" sort of thing????

Hmmmmmm...

Okay, what is it that the Script Maker make?

No, even more specific, what are Script Maker? Who's gonna use my SDK?

- Mod Maker
- Modpack Maker
- Standalone Script Maker

Mod Maker can deal with Minecraft, they can deal with this.

Okay, bad, bad Iteranya, you gotta want to make this thing as comfy as possible.

Which one of my user has the LEAST amount of experience in coding????

Standalone Script Maker, writers and artists.

So, I have to make this thing as super friendly to artists and writers as possible~

(Ahem)

So, we'll design something that artists and writers would want to use... 

I can't make a GUI so they still need code editor

Therefore, I have to start with the simplest thing imaginable

Step 1: Make an empty folder
Step 2: `git clone https://github.com/Iteranya/MobTalkerSDK`
Step 3: Open the thing in VS code
Step 4: Start working

Adding Step 5 like venv, build dependency, etc, will just overcomplicate stuff you see???

Anyway, let's see... What's the easiest way they can start working?????

Template,  definitely, so I'll just have to make something that helps them
