So let's think of it like this
I want each Quest to have a few state:

Locked (Not Visible) -> Triggers
Unlocked (Visible) -> Accepted
In Progress (Visible) -> Completion
Completed (Visible)

Yeah... Another custom compiler...

FUCK!

Anyway~ Am I gonna integrate this to my VN Engine???

Hmm... VN Engine Final State:

- Exploration Feature (To Simulate 'Exploration' or 'Objects Of Intrigue' in Minecraft)
- Question Feature ( To  Simulate Questing, Very Self-Explanatory)
- Dialogue/Cutscene Feature (It's finished, sorta~)
- Character Profile/Inventory Feature (That Sweet Menu Screen~)
- DBMS (For keeping track of all the relevant persistent information)

And somehow, turn this all into a json...
