# Mob Talker Redux SDK

### Yes, I'm doing this...

## Foreword

This thing is made because of how bloody frustrating it is to integrate scripting language like Lua to Minecraft. From the path files that just asking for trouble and the way JVM is... Yeah, no, hell no, I am not compiling anything in Minecraft.

So I ditched Lua and I put together THIS! (Still Under Construction)

What this does is that, you can use this to comfortably build and test your Mob Talker Script, it will then compile everything into a Json FSM. (or a cute little zip containing all the images, data, and such that you can share around and slap into your Minecraft Config Folder)

...

Anyway, if I pull this off, consider Mob Talker Mod revived.
