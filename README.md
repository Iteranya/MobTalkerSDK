# Mob Talker Redux SDK

### Yes, I'm doing this...

## Foreword

This thing is made because of how bloody frustrating it is to integrate scripting language like Lua to Minecraft. From the path files that just asking for trouble and the way JVM is... Yeah, no, hell no, I am not compiling anything in Minecraft.

So I ditched Lua and I put together THIS!

What this does is that, you can use this to comfortably build and test your Mob Talker Script. It's a Mini VN Engine Written in Python, a Java version of this VN Engine is what powers the Mob Talker Mod. You can use this mini VN Engine to transpile and test the Mob Talker script in terminal.

As of this writing, unfortunately, asset management is still manual. This is a tool designed for Mod Developer's use for now. (To Compliment the Mob Talker Redux VN Framework). I want to make a nicer version of this tiny SDK, but eh, this is as far as I can go for now. 

...

Anyway, if I pull this off, consider Mob Talker Mod revived.

## TO DO

- [x] Build A Dummy Script For Testing
- [x] Build A Bunch of Basic Commands
- [x] Build The Compiler
- [x] Build The FSM Reader
- [x] Build The Terminal VN Game Engine
- [ ] Build A Better Read Me
- [ ] Build A Better Documentation

## Features

- An example script to reverse engineer!
- Somewhat Organized Codebase (everything inside Core does the transpiling)
- ~~A Terminal VN Engine "That Just Works" written by Claude!~~ 
- Everything is written by human. AI Coding Attempts have been tried and is immortalized somewhere in the history. Do not use AI. Believe in yourself. Whatever messs you cook up is always better than the sophisticated BS an AI can cook up. I learned this the hard way

(No, I am not a good programmer if you're wondering)
