Only mess with this folder if:

- You know what you're doing
- You want to contribute
- You want to Expand the SDK's functionality (the file you want is module.py and model.py, try not to mess with  the compiler.py if Nested For Loop and Data Structure isn't your fetish)
- You're really, REALLY curious what's an overly simplified FSM Transpiler look like.
- You worship the Flying Spaghetti Monster
